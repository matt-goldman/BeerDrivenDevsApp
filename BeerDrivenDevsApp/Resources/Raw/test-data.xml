            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode — the first half of a special two-part chat — Matt and Liam welcome back <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulyssesmaclaren/">Ulysses Maclaren</a> (aka &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;) from SSW.</p>
<p>We dive deep into the state of AI today: the hype, the breakthroughs, and the very real existential questions it raises. Uly shares insights from his recent talk on AI agents, self-improving systems, and the accelerating pace of change — plus the personal anxieties and excitement that come with trying to keep up.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why even AI advocates get overwhelmed by the pace of change</li>
<li>The difference between AI hype and actual value — and why it’s so easy to get them confused</li>
<li>Synthetic data, agentic AI, and recursive self-improvement</li>
<li>What happens when AIs start training each other (and what could go wrong)</li>
<li>The future of jobs, education, and learning in an AI-driven world</li>
<li>Longevity escape velocity, societal shifts, and the importance of &ldquo;taste&rdquo; in an AI-heavy future</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, it&rsquo;s equal parts thoughtful and silly — including Uly’s worries about becoming obsolete on his 4-month road trip, Liam’s bottle of wine, and Matt’s philosophical rabbit holes.</p>

            <title>Built by Mums, for Mums: The Villey Story</title>
            <description>Lucy Quinlan shares the story of Villey — building a tech company without a tech background, bootstrapping, and the power of trust and community support.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we sit down with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucymansell/">Lucy Quinlan</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://www.villey.co">Villey</a>, a tech startup built by two non-technical founders on a mission to make life easier for busy families.</p>
<p>Before co-founding Villey, Lucy founded Mother’s Help, a highly successful business that supported hundreds of families through a growing team of trusted helpers. When Suzie and Lucy connected, their shared vision was clear. With their unique backgrounds, they saw the potential to build a tech-enabled marketplace connecting families with trusted, verified helpers and to scale practical support to reach even more people. But how do you build a tech company when you can’t write (or read) code?</p>
<p>Lucy shares how she and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suzieplush/">Suzie</a> bootstrapped their idea from a shared pain point, navigated tough product decisions, and assembled a high-trust team that helped them ship an app used by thousands. We talk about pivots, co-founder dynamics, learning on the fly, and the emotional labour of building something meaningful while parenting young kids.</p>
<p>We also dig into:</p>
<ul>
<li>🚫 Why they removed mandatory police checks — and what they learned</li>
<li>🤝 How trust and community shaped their growth strategy</li>
<li>📱 The trade-offs of launching app-first in a web-first world</li>
<li>🧠 Lessons for other non-technical founders entering the tech space</li>
</ul>
<p>This one’s especially for anyone dreaming of starting something without a tech background — and for the rest of us who forgot what it means to build something people truly need.</p>
<p>💬 &ldquo;Where the why is strong enough, you&rsquo;ll find a way.&rdquo; — Lucy</p>
<p>🍻 Drinks:
Liam – Glandore Hunter Valley Shiraz
Matt – Wild Yak Pale Ale (no website since Asahi bought Matilda Bay Brewing from CUB)
Lucy - Looked like a hot drink, but forgot to ask what it was!</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Matt&rsquo;s been to <a href="https://slashnew.tech">/NEW</a>, a tech and dev conference in Newcastle, and he&rsquo;s brought back notes, stories, and insights from a range of brilliant speakers (and maybe a few sticker giveaways too). From financial independence to military simulation tech, diversity in funding, and agentic AI, this episode dives deep into the highlights of the conference.</p>
<p>We cover:</p>
<p>💰 Why “F U” money isn’t about yachts — it’s about freedom
📉 What’s happening in the VC world and why capital is correcting
🚀 Cutting-edge Australian defence tech using modular simulation engines
🧠 The case for valuing people who’ve overcome more (and why you should back them)
🤖 NotebookLM, deep research, and what’s changed since we last spoke to Uly</p>
<p>This one’s jam-packed. If you’re interested in financial independence, ethical investment, Aussie tech success stories, or how AI is changing… everything, there’s something in here for you.</p>

            <title>When It’s Your Job to Stay Calm</title>
            <description>A vulnerable chat on leadership under pressure, balancing empathy and steadiness, and what it really means to be the calm center of a team storm.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>This one started as a ramble — side projects, creative detours, all the usual suspects.</p>
<p>But somewhere in the second act, a theme emerged: what it means to lead a team through the tough stuff. When stress is high, emotions are raw, and everyone’s looking at you — how do you stay calm without going cold?</p>
<p>In contrast to our earlier chat in the now-infamous <em>Burndown Burnout</em> episode — which focused on navigating stakeholders and external pressure — this one turns inward: the emotional labour of being the steady one <em>inside</em> the team.</p>
<p>We talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making space for your team without carrying their stress</li>
<li>How to support individuals without slipping into over-functioning</li>
<li>The difference between empathy and over-identifying</li>
<li>Why being calm isn’t the same as being passive</li>
<li>The tension between being <em>seen</em> to lead vs <em>actually</em> leading</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no script, no tidy arc — just a meandering yarn that ends up in a surprisingly vulnerable place. If you&rsquo;ve ever felt the quiet weight of leadership, this one’s for you.</p>

            <title>Brand or Be Branded</title>
            <description>With guest Sarah Kenyon, we break down personal branding myths, navigating LinkedIn noise, and why &#39;just let the work speak&#39; isn’t always enough.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt and Liam are joined by delivery lead and LinkedIn anti-influencer Sarah Kenyon for a raw, honest yarn about personal branding in tech.</p>
<p>From starting out in your career to the myths of developer stardom, we dive deep into:</p>
<p>🍸 Why your personal brand already exists — whether you like it or not
🔍 How to “curate your algorithm” and avoid the LinkedIn echo chamber
🍺 Why the loudest 5% shape the culture — and why that’s dangerous
🛠️ Four pathways for devs: Not everyone needs to speak at conferences
🧱 The myth of “just let the work speak for itself”
🔥 Why your digital presence is more about opportunities than ego</p>
<p>Whether you’re a backend dev who just wants to do good work or someone chasing the spotlight, this one’s for you.</p>
<p>Plus: Sarah drops some truth bombs on branding, networking, whiskey — and curating a feed that doesn’t make you feel like shit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt and Liam are joined by delivery lead and LinkedIn anti-influencer Sarah Kenyon for a raw, honest yarn about personal branding in tech.</p>
<p>From starting out in your career to the myths of developer stardom, we dive deep into:</p>
<p>🍸 Why your personal brand already exists — whether you like it or not
🔍 How to “curate your algorithm” and avoid the LinkedIn echo chamber
🍺 Why the loudest 5% shape the culture — and why that’s dangerous
🛠️ Four pathways for devs: Not everyone needs to speak at conferences
🧱 The myth of “just let the work speak for itself”
🔥 Why your digital presence is more about opportunities than ego</p>
<p>Whether you’re a backend dev who just wants to do good work or someone chasing the spotlight, this one’s for you.</p>
<p>Plus: Sarah drops some truth bombs on branding, networking, whiskey — and curating a feed that doesn’t make you feel like shit.</p>

            <title>Why Matt Believes a Man Can Fly</title>
            <description>Matt gets personal on Superman, hope, and why stories matter — plus reflections on practical effects, mythology, and backyard birthday laser tag.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this very special episode, Liam and Matt celebrate a milestone: Matt’s 44th birthday and the 44th episode of the podcast! 🎉</p>
<p>To celebrate Liam kindly let Matt geek out on an unusual topic, and we broke from our usual remote setup. Liam came up to Matt’s place, and we recorded this one live in the backyard, each armed with a bottle of Matt’s homebrewed stout.</p>
<p>We dive into one of Matt’s lifelong passions: Superman. But this isn’t just a fandom deep-dive — it’s a look at what Superman represents, why the character resonates across generations, and what it teaches us about hope, resilience, and the human need for heroes.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the 1978 <em>Superman</em> movie still holds up today</li>
<li>How practical effects made us believe a man could fly</li>
<li>The deeper mythology behind Superman as a modern archetype</li>
<li>Why hope matters — even (or especially) in cynical times</li>
<li>How geekdom, storytelling, and technology are deeply intertwined</li>
</ul>
<p>And after the recording? A few beers and a few games of laser tag to properly mark the occasion. 🍻🔫</p>
<p>If you’ve ever believed that stories can change the world — or just want to hear Matt get animated about something that isn’t JavaScript or tech debt — this one’s for you.</p>
<p>🍻 Tonight’s Drinks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt: Matt’s Homebrewed Stout</li>
<li>Liam: Matt’s Homebrewed Stout</li>
</ul>

            <description>We unpack the hype and snake oil behind AI marketing, questioning authenticity and what real, trustworthy engagement should look like.</description>

<p>✔️ AI marketing: genuinely useful or just bandwagon buzzwords?
✔️ The rise of “vibe coding” and its impact on trust
✔️ Resume-Driven Design and its connection to tech stack decisions
✔️ The cult of the personality-driven salesperson
✔️ What accountability looks like in a world of infinite noise

            <title>Is the .NET ecosystem in crisis?</title>
            <description>We tackle the wave of open-source projects going commercial in .NET, community trust, and what it means for the future of the ecosystem.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this special bonus episode, Matt and Liam dive deep into a question that’s been simmering beneath the surface: Is the .NET ecosystem heading for trouble?</p>
<p>From the IdentityServer “rug pull” to Jimmy Bogard’s recent move to commercialise Automapper and MediatR, we explore what it means when open-source maintainers shift to paid models, and how the community responds. Is this a betrayal, or simply what’s needed to sustain the tools we all rely on?</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>How .NET’s open-source soul is clashing with enterprise realities</li>
<li>Why frustration is growing—among maintainers and users alike</li>
<li>The moral dilemma of building businesses on free tools</li>
<li>Whether .NET is falling back into its “enterprise-only” trap</li>
<li>What needs to change for .NET open source to survive—and thrive</li>
</ul>
<p>We wrap by proposing a live community conversation on the future of .NET OSS. If you’re a maintainer, contributor, or just someone who cares deeply about the ecosystem, stay tuned. We want your voice in the next round!</p>

            <title>Conventions? Give it a REST!</title>
            <description>A fiery debate on REST conventions, idempotence, and when breaking the &#39;rules&#39; of API design is genius — or just lazy.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt and Liam dust off a six-year-old debate about REST, conventions, and the art of building predictable APIs.</p>
<p>From 404 vs 403, to POSTs that aren&rsquo;t quite posts, they ask:
Should your API tell the truth, or just be polite about it?</p>
<p>They discuss:
✔️ Why REST isn’t a standard, but a set of conventions
✔️ Whether idempotence is worth chasing
✔️ When it’s okay to break RESTful norms (and when it’s just lazy)
✔️ The surprising UX parallels between API design and toilet buttons 🚽
✔️ Why “Don’t Make Me Think” isn’t just for UI designers</p>
<p>Plus: BBQ fires, near-death corn, and the Dunning-Kruger effect of REST philosophy.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt and Liam dive into one of the spiciest debates in the software world: What do open source maintainers actually owe their community?

<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expectations placed on maintainers and why they burn out</li>
<li>Whether open source projects should come with service-level guarantees</li>
<li>The blurred line between community contributions and unpaid work</li>
<li>Real-world examples of OSS drama, gratitude, and frustration</li>
<li>How to support the projects you rely on, without being &ldquo;that person&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt and Liam dive into one of the spiciest debates in the software world: What do open source maintainers actually owe their community? From unpaid labour to entitlement, we explore the tension between contributors and consumers in the open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The expectations placed on maintainers and why they burn out</li>
<li>Whether open source projects should come with service-level guarantees</li>
<li>The blurred line between community contributions and unpaid work</li>
<li>Real-world examples of OSS drama, gratitude, and frustration</li>
<li>How to support the projects you rely on, without being &ldquo;that person&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve ever used an open source library, contributed to one, or found yourself waiting on an issue fix, this episode is for you.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we challenge the conventional wisdom of career progression in tech. The traditional path - junior, mid, senior, team lead, manager - suggests an inevitable trajectory, but is it really the only way? Matt and Liam dive into the realities of career growth, exploring why leadership and management are not the same thing and why moving &ldquo;back&rdquo; to an engineering role isn’t necessarily a step down.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The false assumption that career growth means leaving the tools behind</li>
<li>Why top engineering talent often gets promoted out of doing what they love</li>
<li>The rise of the Staff Engineer role and other alternatives to the management track</li>
<li>Lessons from Microsoft and other major companies on leadership vs. management</li>
<li>The importance of knowing what truly motivates you in your career</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re navigating your own career shift or wondering what’s next, this episode is a candid discussion on finding fulfilment in your work—whether that’s leading teams, staying hands-on, or redefining success altogether.</p>

            <title>Has JavaScript outstayed its welcome?</title>
            <description>A passionate rant on the quirks and limitations of JavaScript, and whether emerging tech (like WASI and Rust) might finally set us free from it.</description>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Matt rants about JavaScript—the language we all use, but few truly love. Is JavaScript objectively bad? Not necessarily. But it lacks the luxuries of more modern languages and is arguably a legacy technology that holds back innovation in UI development.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why JavaScript was never meant for modern web applications</li>
<li>The lowest-common-denominator problem and how it stifles progress</li>
<li>How React, TypeScript, Next.js, and other frameworks exist just to fix JavaScript&rsquo;s shortcomings</li>
<li>The death of plugins (Silverlight, Flash, Java Applets) and how it forced JavaScript dominance</li>
<li>What could finally break JavaScript’s stranglehold on frontend development</li>
<li>The trade-offs: Standardisation vs. Specialisation—what does this mean for devs and businesses?</li>
<li>The browser has evolved into an OS in all but name, but unlike a real OS, it&rsquo;s stuck with JavaScript forever. Could WASI open the door to Rust, Zig, Go, and lower-level languages replacing JavaScript? And what would that mean for the future of frontend development?</li>
</ul>
<p>Join us for this unfiltered discussion on the past, present, and potential future of UI development—and why JavaScript’s best feature might be that we won’t need it anymore.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode we dive into a discussion about technical debt in software development and its impact on project management and team performance. Matt and Liam discuss how accumulating technical debt can subtly affect a team’s velocity until critical issues arise. We share experiences from past projects, comparing technical debt to financial debt, emphasising its compounding nature and potential to cripple productivity if not addressed.</p>
<p>Liam shares insights on maintaining legacy applications and navigating inherited technical debt, using a recent project as an example. We draw parallels between software and monetary debt, likening tech debt to car maintenance—necessary to avoid costly breakdowns.</p>
<p>Our discussion covers managing technical debt while balancing new feature demands and ongoing maintenance. We debate documenting technical debt in a backlog and communicating its impact to non-technical stakeholders. Strategies for justifying resource allocation to repay tech debt while providing immediate value are explored.</p>
<p>Drawing on ideas raised during the panel discussion &ldquo;Rebuilds, Rewrites, Refactors, Oh My&rdquo; at <a href="https://adaconf.org">ADAConf</a>, we discuss the pitfalls of refactoring versus rebuilding applications, emphasising continuous communication and setting realistic client expectations. By the end, we hope to shed light on the importance of addressing technical debt early to prevent significant challenges, much like maintaining a car prolongs its lifespan.</p>

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we dive into the ethics of open-source software and the fine line between community-driven contributions and corporate exploitation. We focus on the recent controversy surrounding WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg and WP Engine, a major player in the WordPress hosting space.

<p>We explore the motivations behind open-source contributions, the ethical dilemmas posed by corporate use of these projects, and the burnout many maintainers face.

            <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>In our 26th episode, <em>Beer Driven Devs</em> comes full circle. Exactly one year ago, we launched this podcast by diving into the controversy surrounding Unity’s runtime fee. Now, 12 months later, Unity’s fee has been cancelled, and we’re back to where it all started—reflecting on how much has changed, both for Unity and for us.</p>
<p>We discuss the major shifts within Unity over the past year, from leadership changes to community backlash and what the company’s recent fee reversal means for the future of game development. We also take a moment to celebrate our podcast’s first anniversary and look back at our journey—from the spontaneous idea that led to <em>Beer Driven Devs</em> to the valuable lessons we’ve learned along the way.</p>

As software engineers, enterprise developers, or solution architects, problem solving is at the core of what we do each and every day.

Or better yet, does every problem even need to be solved?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In every aspect of our lives, professional or otherwise, we face problems. As software engineers, enterprise developers, or solution architects, problem solving is at the core of what we do each and every day. This week Liam and Matt discuss their tools and experiences in problem solving, and and ask the question, is DDD right? Is there always a domain solution to every problem? Or better yet, does every problem even need to be solved?</p>
<p>Tell us on Twitter (we refuse to call it &lsquo;X&rsquo;) or LinkedIn your tips for tackling the difficult problems.</p>
